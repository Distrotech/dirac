1.0.10
======

 - Build fixes on various platforms
 - Speed increases for low-delay syntax
 - Fix unaligned access in orc code, which was uncovered by a recent
   Orc bug fix.  Bump orc requirement to 0.4.10, which makes sure
   everyone works right.
 - No encoder changes

1.0.9
=====

 - Orc: Complete conversion to Orc and removal of liboil dependency.
 - Added a lot of orc code to make things faster.  A lot faster.
 - New motion vector generation, enabled by default.
 - New CBR rate control, enabled by default.
 - New scene change detection, enabled by default.
 - Encoder went through several rounds of tuning, improving quality
   greatly.
 - New encoder setting "force-profile".  Allows easy access to one of
   three VC-2 profiles (vc2_low_delay, vc2_simple, vc2_main) for
   intermediate coding.  Default is same as before: long-GOP Dirac.
 - Improved lossless encoding.  Works in concert with force-profile.


1.0.8
=====

 - encoder: various performance enhancements
 - Orc: More Orc conversion.  The next release will likely require Orc
   to build.
 - Add a fast path for 8x8 non-obmc motion blocks.
 - encoder: Fix the queue-depth setting so that it actually works.
 - Fix a bitstream conformance bug.  Shows up as a psychadelic color
   pattern.  Broken bitstreams should be uncommon, however, if the
   decoder detects a broken bitstream, it will be played correctly.
 - Move GStreamer plugin to gst-plugins-bad
 - encoder: Strictly enforce bit rate.  Encoded pictures are cut off
   if they are larger than the available buffer.
 - encoder: Change the backref engine to use an IPPPP... structure,
   using the last two pictures as references.

1.0.7
=====

 - Somebody forgot to write release notes for 1.0.7

1.0.6
=====

 - Requires liboil-0.3.16
 - New configure flag '--disable-encoder' useful for embedded
   systems that don't require the encoder.
 - New constant-quality encoding mode, enabled by setting the encoder
   setting 'rate-control' to 6, and adjusting 'quality' from 0 to 10.
   (Interesting range is 3-7).
 - Various encoder improvements
 - Speed improvements in decoder
 - API additions for parsing streams in the decoder
 - API improvements handling interlaced video
 - Rewrite of the GStreamer elements, including new base classes
   for video encoding and decoding
 - Moved extra GStreamer elements to Cog
 - Experimental code that uses Orc instead of liboil (--enable-orc)

1.0.5-1.0.2
===========

 - ...

1.0.1
=====

 - Add API reference documentation for SchroDecoder.
 - Restructure API reference documentation, although coverage is very
   low.
 - Default GOP structure now uses 3 reference frames.  This gives a
   very slight improvement in quality.
 - Fix encode/decode mismatch for low-delay syntax.
 - Fix brokenness in CBR intra-only encoding
 - Additional testing and code cleanups
 - Eliminate artificial width limitation in encoder and decoder.
 - Fix encoding/decoding of video offset and excursion.
 - Fix granulepos calculation in GStreamer encoder element
 - Set DELTA_UNIT correctly in GStreamer encoder element
 - Update code path used when pthread is disabled.

1.0.0
=====

 - Major release

0.2.1
=====

 - Encoder and decoder nearly complete.  The bitstream is nearly
   compatible with Dirac, except in a few cases for predicted frames.
   Note that the Dirac bitstream isn't frozen, so that's kind of
   irrelevant.
 - Requires liboil-0.3.10.
