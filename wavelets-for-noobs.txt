A wavelet is a small wave function (where a wave function is a
representation of a real-world wave), giving a value y as a function
of input x.

The bandwidth of a wavelet is the domain where the wave function is
non-zero. By scaling x by a factor 1/s the resulting value will be in
the bandwidth of the wave.
