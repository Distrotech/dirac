A wavelet is a small wave function (where a wave function is a
representation of a real-world wave), giving a value y as a function
of input x.

The bandwidth of a wavelet is the domain where the wave function is
non-zero. By scaling x by a factor 1/s the resulting value will be within
the bandwidth of the wave. 

The `transform' part is derived from the fact that
* you can represent any transformation as a matrix
* any such representation must have determinant 1, and
* thus they can all be factored into type 3 elementary matrices, and
* as a last treat you can expand any function as a (Laurent) polynomial,
  which are just polynomials that allow negative powers, allowing them
  to be factored.

Thus, you can do a wavelet transform without ever seeing a wave at
all. In practice for the transforms in Dirac, that means predicting
odd values by their neighbouring even values, subtracting that
prediction from the value and storing it, and repeating with even and
odd. Then the odd values are the high band and the even values the low
band.
