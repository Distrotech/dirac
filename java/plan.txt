Small steps to java schroedinger:
x#1    Write a test program for the the decoder	
x#2    Fix the Video Format difference that doesn't exist bug 
x#3    Fix the `negative array size' (Ie, Unpack error) bug
x#4    Implement picture header parsing
x#5    Fix reference picture managment (was Unpack bug)
x#6    Implement picture parsing
#7     Figure out how to structure decoding (I'd like not to create
       a million `helper' classes).
#8     Implement subband decoding (and preferably interleaving)
#99    Fix the Unpack.skip() error
