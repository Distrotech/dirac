Small steps to java schroedinger:
x#1    Write a test program for the the decoder	
x#2    Fix the Video Format difference that doesn't exist bug 
x#3    Fix the `negative array size' (Ie, Unpack error) bug
x#4    Implement picture header parsing
x#5    Fix reference picture managment (was Unpack bug)
x#6    Implement picture parsing
x#7    Figure out how to structure decoding (I'd like not to create
       a million `helper' classes).
x#8    Implement subband decoding (first component only)
x#9    Implement short[]-to-image conversion
x#10   Fix colorspace conversion (at least initially)
x#11   Start arithmetic decoder
x#12   Fix spatial partitioning and colour
x#13   Fix arithmetic unpacking of Subbands (sign prediction almost done)
x#14   Implement motion vector structures 
x#15   Decode motion vectors
#16    Implement motion decoding
#17    Make initial cortado plugin
#18    Fix cortado plugin
#30    Profile decoder and speed it up
