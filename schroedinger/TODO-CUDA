- make playback less stuttery?
   - might not be a problem in normal mode if frames are throttled
   - frame skipping does not yet work for GPU
   - multithreaded decoding
- make gpu stuff completely asynchronous
   - async mem transfers
     - all done?
   - use event api to check for frame readiness ?

- multithreaded 
   - more CPU threads can feed data to GPU in parallel
     (multiple schrodecoder structures)
   - make some work division between threads
   - video format, frame queue and reference queue, next_frame_number, ... must be shared
   - one GPU thread that does all GPU things, communicated via queue
     asynchronous only
   - watch out with retiring frames; make sure all frames before the retire
     command have been handled before doing it

- clear up non-gpu stuff in gpu decoder

- fix schro_decoder_error in schro_decoder_decode_access_unit

- swap order of motion compensation and wavelet transform, as the motion comp has to wait for reference frames to 
  become available
