- make playback less stuttery?
   - might not be a problem in normal mode if frames are throttled
   - frame skipping does not yet work for GPU

- make gpu stuff completely asynchronous
   - async mem transfers
     - all done?
   - use event api to check for frame readiness ?

- multithreaded 
   - more CPU threads can feed data to GPU in parallel
     (multiple schrodecoder structures)
   - make some work division between threads
   - video format, frame queue and reference queue, next_frame_number, ... must be shared
   - one GPU thread that does all GPU things, communicated via queue
     asynchronous only
   - watch out with retiring frames; make sure all frames before the retire
     command have been handled before doing it

- fix schro_decoder_error in schro_decoder_decode_access_unit

- Would it be possible to do SCHRO_DECODER_MOTION_DECODE/
  SCHRO_DECODER_WAVELET_DECODE in parallel? (are the offsets known in advance?)

- split up schrodecoderworker.c, it's one big ugly file

- we need a finalize state as well, we crash at the end

- reintroduce Async overlap in serial subband copy, using GPU thread
