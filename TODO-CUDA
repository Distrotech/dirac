- make playback less stuttery?
   - might not be a problem in normal mode if frames are throttled
   - frame skipping does not yet work for GPU

- make gpu stuff completely asynchronous
   - async mem transfers
     - all done?
   - use event api to check for frame readiness ?
   - reintroduce Async overlap in serial subband copy, using GPU thread
   - use streams api to transfer memory at the same time as
     decoding another frame
     - a stream for ecah worker
     - cudaStream_t <<< Dg, Db, Ns, S >>>
     - cudaStreamCreate(&workers[x].stream);
     - cudaStreamDestroy
     - cudaStreamQuery
     - Execute all memory transfers and kernels for a worker unit in this stream
     - cudaMemcpyAsync

- fix schro_decoder_error in schro_decoder_decode_access_unit

- Would it be possible to do SCHRO_DECODER_MOTION_DECODE/
  SCHRO_DECODER_WAVELET_DECODE in parallel? (are the offsets known in advance?)

- split up schrodecoderworker.c, it's one big ugly file


- various queue sizes
  when are they large enough to be safe?
#define SCHRO_RETIRE_QUEUE_SIZE 40
#define UQUEUE_SIZE 40 /* Max number of stored ref frames (GPU) */
