Schroedinger 1.0.9
==================

A new release of Schrödinger is available. Schrödinger (or “schro”
for short) is a cross-platform implementation of the Dirac video
compression specification as a C library. Many media frameworks
such as GStreamer and ffmpeg and applications such as VLC use schro
to encode and decode Dirac video.

The Dirac project maintains two encoder implementations: dirac-research,
a research encoder, and Schrödinger, which is meant for user applications.
As of this release, Schrödinger outperforms dirac-research in most
encoding situations, both in terms of encoding speed and visual
quality.

It's been a long time since the last release, and there have been a
*lot* of changes.  This is an exciting release: most of the encoding
tools in dirac-research have been ported over to Schrödinger, so now
schro has the same or better compression efficiency as dirac-research.
Second, we've switched over to using Orc instead of liboil for signal
processing code.  Dirac is a very configurable format, and normally
would require thousands of lines of assembly code -- Orc generates
this at runtime from simple rules.  (Hey, it was easier to write Orc
than write all that assembly!)

Third, we now have an encoder quality testing system in place to check
how well new encoding tools work and to make sure bugs that affect
quality are quickly fixed.


Roadmap:  Only a few people are working on schro, and only part time,
so new features will happen only slowly.  However, now that merging
is done and the release is out, there are several new features that
are easy to add that will improve encoder quality.  We'd like to get
back to more frequent releases, perhaps one a month, introducing a
new encoder feature each time.


Other News: Portions of the Dirac specification are now standardized
as SMPTE VC-2.  VC-2 is mostly used in high bit rate applications,
such as intermediate formats for editing and storage and a low delay
format for studio application.

New in 1.0.9
============

 - Orc: Complete conversion to Orc and removal of liboil dependency.
 - Added a lot of orc code to make things faster.  A lot faster.
 - New motion vector generation, enabled by default.
 - New CBR rate control, enabled by default.
 - New scene change detection, enabled by default.
 - Encoder went through several rounds of tuning, improving quality
   greatly.
 - New encoder setting "force-profile".  Allows easy access to one of
   three VC-2 profiles (vc2_low_delay, vc2_simple, vc2_main) for
   intermediate coding.  Default is same as before: long-GOP Dirac.
 - Improved lossless encoding.  Works in concert with force-profile.
