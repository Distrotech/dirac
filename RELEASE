Schroedinger 1.0.10
===================

A new release of Schrödinger is available. Schrödinger (or “schro”
for short) is a cross-platform implementation of the Dirac video
compression specification as a C library. Many media frameworks
such as GStreamer and ffmpeg and applications such as VLC use schro
to encode and decode Dirac video.

The Dirac project maintains two encoder implementations: dirac-research,
a research encoder, and Schrödinger, which is meant for user applications.
Schrödinger outperforms dirac-research in most encoding situations, both
in terms of encoding speed and visual quality.

Roadmap:  Only a few people are working on schro, and only part time,
so new features will happen only slowly.

New in 1.0.10
=============

 - Build fixes on various platforms
 - Speed increases for low-delay syntax
 - Fix unaligned access in orc code, which was uncovered by a recent
   Orc bug fix.  Bump orc requirement to 0.4.10, which makes sure
   everyone works right.
 - No encoder changes
